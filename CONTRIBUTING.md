# OSS contribution rules

## Coding guidelines

- Please follow the existing conventions in the relevant file / namespace when you add new code or when you extend/fix existing functionality.

- To maintain consistency in code formatting and style, you should run `clang-format` on the modified sources with the provided configuration file.

- Format individual source files:
  ```shell
  # -style=file : Obtain the formatting rules from .clang-format
  # -i          : In-place modification of the processed file
  clang-format -style=file -fallback-style=none -i <file(s) to process>
  ```

- Format entire codebase (for project maintainers only):
  ```shell
  find src include test -iname *.hpp -o -iname *.cpp \
    | xargs clang-format -style=file -fallback-style=none -i
  ```

- Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity into existing code so that maintainability and readability are preserved.

- Keep pull requests (PRs) as concise as possible:
    - Avoid committing commented-out code.
    - Each PR should address a single concern.
    - If there are several otherwise-unrelated things that should be fixed to reach a desired endpoint, our recommendation is to open several PRs and indicate dependencies in the descriptions.

- Ensure that the build log is clean, meaning no warnings or errors should be present.

- Ensure that all unit tests pass prior to submitting your code.

- All components should have an accompanying test.

- To add or disable functionality:
    - Add a CMake option with a default value that matches the existing behavior.
    - Where entire files can be included/excluded based on the value of this option, selectively include/exclude the relevant files from compilation by modifying `CMakeLists.txt` rather than using `#if` guards around the entire body of each file.
    - Where the functionality involves minor changes to existing files, use `#if` guards.

- Make sure that you can contribute your work to open source (no license and/or patent conflict is introduced by your code). You will need to [`sign`](#signing-your-work) your commit.

- Thanks in advance for your patience as we review your contributions; we do appreciate them!


## Pull requests
Developer workflow for code contributions is as follows:

1. Developers must first [fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the [upstream](https://github.com/nvidia/nvhashmap) nvHashMap repository.

2. Git clone the forked repository and push changes to your personal fork.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git nvhashmap
    git push -u origin <local-branch>:<remote-branch>
    ```

3. Once the code changes are staged on the fork and ready for review, initiate a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) (PR) to merge the changes from a branch of your fork into a selected branch of *upstream*.
    * If your PR relates to an issue, please link the issue in the description of your PR.
    * Exercise caution when selecting the source and target branches for the PR.
    * Creation of a PR kicks off the code review process.
    * While under review, mark your PRs as work-in-progress by prefixing the PR title with [WIP].

4. Since there is no CI/CD process in place yet, the PR will be accepted and thereby resolved issues closed only after adequate testing has been manually completed by us.


## Signing your work

* We require that all contributors *sign-off* on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have the rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

* Contributions which contain commits that are not signed-off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```shell
  git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
